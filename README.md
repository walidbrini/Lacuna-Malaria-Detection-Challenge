# Lacuna Malaria Detection Challenge

[Zindi Competition Link](https://zindi.africa/competitions/lacuna-malaria-detection-challenge/data)

## About

The Lacuna Malaria Detection Challenge focuses on leveraging Computer Vision techniques to aid in the rapid and accurate diagnosis of malaria, particularly in low-resource settings. The images in the dataset were captured by placing a smartphone over a microscope to capture the Field of View (FOV) of the blood slide through the eyepiece of the microscope. Alongside each image, the slide from which the image was captured, the stage micrometer readings of the microscope, and the objective lens settings were recorded. A maximum of 40 images was captured from each slide.

This blood slide image dataset is curated to improve machine learning models that can generalize to data collected in other communities, such as those in Uganda. It adds to existing malaria microscopy datasets, offering a valuable resource for developing algorithms capable of identifying parasites and blood cells in microscopic images from malaria patients.

- **Training Images**: 2747
- **Test Images**: 1178
